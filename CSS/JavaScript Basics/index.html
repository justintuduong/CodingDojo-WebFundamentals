            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take itin a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a hosenvironment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to theobjects of these environments  to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScriptvariables are containers for storing data values = imagine a cup youfill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. Theseunique names are called identifiers. <span class="purpleMe">var x>;</span> 
                </li><br>

                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators    assign values to JavaScript variables = out cup can now have coffee poured     in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator   assigns a values to a variable. <span class="purpleMe">var x = 10;</span>
                </li><br>

                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Data Types</span> Data types are an important  concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the datatype.   There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- <span class="purpleMe">true</span> or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159;String - <span class="purpleMe">Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>"
                </li><br>

                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different cod    blocks based on values of conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in you code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the  first condition is false; else we can execute this block of code;
                </li><br>

                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Loops</span> There are many different kinds ofloops in every programming language, but they all essentially do thesame thing:they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine youhave to fun a mile, well you run around the track four times and thenyou stop. That is a loop!
                </li><br>


                <li><span class="turquoiseMe">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code clock. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started  first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
